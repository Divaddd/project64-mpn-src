# Project64 MPN
Modified Project64 2.3.2 for use in the Mario Party Netplay Discord server. Made to allow for an easier netplay experience than Kaillera that supports many more games, and includes convenience factors like GameShark codes and save files to have everything ready from the get-go.

Project64 MPN encorporates the following libraries in addition to what Project64 already uses:

* AQZ Netplay Input Plugin - [GitHub](https://github.com/CoderTimZ/NetplayInputPlugin) | [Website](https://www.play64.com/)
* Discord RPC - [GitHub](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc) | [Website](https://discordapp.com/developers/)
* miniUPnP Client - [GitHub](https://github.com/miniupnp/miniupnp/tree/master/miniupnpc) | [Website](http://miniupnp.free.fr/)

[Boost](https://www.boost.org/) is a requirement for building as well. Under Visual Studio, the correct Boost path must be configured after installation.
